          Hello there! I'm Chaitanya Karthik Basva, a recent graduate with a
          passion for coding and a penchant for problem-solving. As a Full Stack
          Developer specializing in the MERN stack, I thrive on crafting
          seamless digital experiences from front-end to back-end. With a solid
          foundation in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), I bring a unique
          blend of creativity and precision to every project I tackle. Whether
          I'm diving into complex code or architecting elegant solutions, I'm
          always excited to push the boundaries of what's possible in the world
          of web development.
